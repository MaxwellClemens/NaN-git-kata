Once upon a time, there was an old man.
His friends called him Jeremy, but he really wanted to be called JerBear.
Jeremy took a trip across the pond to Europe. Upon his arrival he discovered that the beer was quite mediocre. 
NO AC.
Public transit smelled bad because someone ate too many beans.

Jeremy went to a vineyard. He saw tons of peaches and picked a peach for himself.

He came back home with a vast array of stories and happy memories. 
He felt bad that all the young punks at work hadn't yet had the chance to build up such a wealth of joyous memories yet.
