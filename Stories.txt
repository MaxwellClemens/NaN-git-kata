Once upon a time, there was an old man.
His friends called him Jeremy, but he really wanted to be called JerBear.
NO AC.
Public transit smelled bad because someone ate too many beans.

He came back home with a vast array of stories and happy memories. 
He felt bad that all the young punks at work hadn't yet had the chance to build up such a wealth of joyous memories yet.
