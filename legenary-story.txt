Once upon a time, there was an old man.
His friends called him Jeremy, but he really wanted to be called JerBear.

Jeremy went to a vineyard. He saw tons of peaches and picked a peach for himself.

He came back home with a vast array of stories and happy memories. 
He felt bad that all the young punks at work hadn't yet had the chance to build up such a wealth of joyous memories yet.
