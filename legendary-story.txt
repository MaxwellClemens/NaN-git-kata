Once upon a time, there was a chill old man.
He had many friends that called him JerBear, but really his name was Jeremy.

Since the air conditioning at his hotel was simply a nice looking box with bricks inside, Jeremy thought he should take
the public transit for his tree-hunting trip. Fortunately, the AC did work in the bus but oh man, it smelled like someone had
eaten too many beans and let it all go.
