Once upon a time, there was a chill old man.
He had many friends that called him JerBear, but really his name was Jeremy.

Since the air conditioning at his hotel was simply a nice looking box with bricks inside, Jeremy thought he should take
the public transit for his tree-hunting trip. Fortunately, the AC did work in the bus but oh man, it smelled like someone had
eaten too many beans and let it all go.

Jeremy went to Europe. In Europe Jeremy got a beer and said, "THIS SUCKS!"

He went to a Vineyard to look at some trees. He saw the amazing trees and picked a peach for himself.
